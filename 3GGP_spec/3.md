Of course. To make your entire 5G simulator compliant, you'll need a structured, multi-phase approach. The goal isn't to replicate every bit and byte, but to ensure your architecture, interfaces, and key procedures align with the 3GPP standards.

Your current service-based design is the perfect foundation. Here's a comprehensive strategy to achieve compliance across the 5G Core and RAN.

-----

## Phase 1: Architectural & Interface Compliance (The Blueprint) üó∫Ô∏è

The first step is to ensure the "skeleton" of your simulator matches the 3GPP architecture. This means every component communicates over the correct, standardized interface.

### Step 1.1: Map Your Services to 3GPP Network Functions

Confirm that each of your Python services correctly maps to a 3GPP entity. Your current structure looks great.

| Your File (`.py`) | 3GPP Network Function (NF) | Role |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `nrf.py` | NRF (Network Repository Function) | Service discovery |
| `amf.py` | AMF (Access and Mobility Management) | Manages registration, connection, mobility |
| `smf.py` | SMF (Session Management Function) | Manages PDU sessions (data connections) |
| `upf.py` | UPF (User Plane Function) | Forwards user data traffic (packets) |
| `ausf.py` | AUSF (Authentication Server Function) | Handles authentication |
| `udm.py`/`udr.py` | UDM/UDR (Unified Data Management/Repo) | Manages user subscription data |
| `gnb.py` | gNB (Next Generation NodeB) | RAN base station |
| `cu.py`/`du.py` | CU/DU (Central/Distributed Unit) | Split components of the gNB |

### Step 1.2: Implement Standard Reference Points

Ensure the API calls between your services model the official 3GPP reference points.

Here are the most critical interfaces to model:

| Interface | Connects | Your Implementation Task |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **N1** | UE ‚Üî AMF | Model the NAS (Non-Access Stratum) messages between a simulated UE and your `amf.py`. |
| **N2** | gNB ‚Üî AMF | Refactor the `gnb.py` to `amf.py` communication to use NGAP message structures. |
| **N3** | gNB ‚Üî UPF | Model the GTP-U tunnel for user data between `gnb.py` and `upf.py`. |
| **N4** | SMF ‚Üî UPF | Implement an API where `smf.py` sends session rules (PFCP messages) to `upf.py`. |
| **N6** | UPF ‚Üî DN | Your `upf.py` service must correctly route traffic to an external data network service. |
| **N11** | AMF ‚Üî SMF | Refactor `amf.py` to `smf.py` calls for session management (e.g., PDU session create). |
| **N12** | AMF ‚Üî AUSF | Your `amf.py` must call `ausf.py` for authentication procedures. |

## Phase 2: Procedural Compliance (The Call Flows) üìû

With the architecture in place, the next step is to implement the end-to-end message sequences for key network operations as defined in **3GPP TS 23.502**.

### Step 2.1: Implement Key End-to-End Procedures

Focus on the most important procedures first. Trace the full call flow for each one across your services.

1.  **UE Registration:** This is the most fundamental flow. It involves the gNB, AMF, AUSF, and UDM. Your simulator should correctly model the exchange of messages for authentication and context setup.
2.  **PDU Session Establishment:** This is how a user gets a data connection. The call flow goes from AMF to SMF, and then the SMF instructs the UPF and gNB to set up the data path (N3 and N6 interfaces).
3.  **Service Request:** This procedure handles a UE moving from an IDLE to a CONNECTED state to send data.

### Step 2.2: Example: PDU Session Establishment in `smf.py`

Your `smf.py` must expose an API that the AMF can call. This function would then communicate with the UPF.

```python
# In smf.py

# This endpoint models the Nsmf_PDUSession service
@app.post("/nsmf-pdusession/v1/sm-contexts")
async def create_pdu_session(request: Request):
    """
    This function is called by the AMF (over N11) to create a new PDU session.
    """
    request_data = await request.json()
    supi = request_data.get("supi")
    pdu_session_id = request_data.get("pduSessionId")
    logger.info(f"SMF: Received PDU Session establishment request for SUPI {supi}")

    # 1. SMF selects a UPF (can be hardcoded in a simulator)
    upf_id = "upf001"
    
    # 2. SMF establishes an N4 session with the selected UPF
    # This involves sending a PFCP Session Establishment Request
    pfcp_rule = {
        "sessionId": f"session-{pdu_session_id}",
        "pdr": {"match": "ue_ip_address", "action": "forward"}, # Simplified Packet Detection Rule
        "far": {"destination": "N6_INTERFACE"}  # Simplified Forwarding Action Rule
    }
    
    # This API call represents the N4 interface
    try:
        response = requests.post(f"{upf_url}/n4/session", json=pfcp_rule)
        response.raise_for_status()
        logger.info(f"SMF: N4 Session established with UPF {upf_id}")
    except requests.RequestException as e:
        logger.error(f"SMF: Failed to establish N4 session with UPF: {e}")
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail="UPF interaction failed")

    # 3. SMF responds to AMF with the result
    return {"status": "PDU_SESSION_CREATED", "upf_endpoint": response.json().get("n3_endpoint")}
```

## Phase 3: Data & Protocol Layer Compliance (The Details) üî¨

This is the deepest level of compliance, focusing on data structures and simulating the behavior of the RAN protocol stack.

### Step 3.1: Standardize Information Models

All data structures, especially the UE Context, must use 3GPP-defined parameters. For example, the context for a user in your AMF should contain fields like:

  * `SUPI` (Subscription Permanent Identifier)
  * `5G-GUTI` (5G Globally Unique Temporary Identifier)
  * `SecurityContext`
  * `AllowedNssai` (Network Slice Selection Assistance Information)
  * `PduSessionStatus`

### Step 3.2: Model the RAN Protocol Stack

For a simulator, you don't need to perform real-time signal processing. Instead, you model the *function* of each protocol layer in your CU and DU services.

  * **RRC (in `cu.py`):** Implement a state machine for the UE's RRC state (e.g., `RRC_IDLE`, `RRC_CONNECTED`). Your functions will transition the UE between these states.
  * **PDCP/SDAP (in `cu.py`):** Your functions can simulate header compression and ciphering by logging the action and adding a small, calculated processing delay.
  * **RLC/MAC (in `du.py`):** Model segmentation and scheduling. For a given data block, your code can calculate how many smaller blocks it would be split into and log this, rather than actually performing the splitting.
  * **PHY (in `du.py`):** This is the most abstract layer in a simulator. You can model it by applying a pre-defined latency and bit-error rate to data transfers based on a simulated signal quality (e.g., "good," "medium," "poor").

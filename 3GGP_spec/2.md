Of course. Making your 5G simulator 3GPP-compliant means mapping your custom functions to official procedures, implementing standardized interfaces and data models, and meticulously logging the message flows for verification.

Your current codebase is an excellent starting point because it already separates network functions (NFs) into distinct services. Hereâ€™s a roadmap to align it with 3GPP standards.

-----

### 1\. Define Your Compliance Scope ðŸŽ¯

You can't make everything compliant at once. The key is to pick one or two critical procedures and focus on them first. Based on your existing code, good candidates are:

  * **UE Initial Registration:** The process of a UE attaching to the network.
  * **PDU Session Establishment:** How a UE gets a data connection.
  * **Xn-based Handover:** The handover process you've already started simulating.

For these, your two most important reference documents will be:

  * **3GPP TS 23.501:** Defines the overall 5G System Architecture.
  * **3GPP TS 23.502:** Details the call flows and procedures between network functions.

-----

### 2\. Implement Standardized Procedures and Interfaces

This is the core of the work, involving three main changes to your code.

#### A. Map Your Code to 3GPP Call Flows

Think of this as turning your high-level functions into detailed sequence diagrams from the 3GPP specs. Each step in the official call flow should correspond to a specific API call or internal function in your simulator.

For example, the "UE Initial Registration" procedure is a multi-step dance between the UE, gNB, AMF, AUSF, and UDM. Your code should reflect this sequence.

#### B. Use Service-Based Interfaces (SBI)

The 5G Core uses a Service-Based Architecture (SBA), where network functions communicate via RESTful APIs. Your use of FastAPI is already perfectly aligned with this concept. The next step is to make your API endpoints and methods match the 3GPP-defined services.

  * **Your Current Method:**
    You have a custom endpoint like `POST /amf/handover`.

  * **3GPP-Compliant Method:**
    A real AMF exposes services like `Namf_Communication`. A handover trigger would involve a more specific, standardized endpoint. For instance, a request from a source AMF to a target AMF to create a UE context during a handover would look more like:
    `POST /namf-comm/v2/ue-contexts`

#### C. Use Standard Information Elements (IEs)

The JSON payloads in your API calls should use standardized parameter names (Information Elements) instead of custom ones.

  * **Your Current Payload:**

    ```json
    {"ue_id": "ue001", "source_gnb_id": "gnb001"}
    ```

  * **3GPP-Compliant Payload:**
    The payload would be much more detailed, using standardized names and structures defined in the specs. The `ue_id` would be represented by a SUPI (Subscription Permanent Identifier) or GUTI (Globally Unique Temporary Identifier).

    ```json
    {
      "supi": "imsi-123456789012345",
      "servingNfId": "gnb001-uuid",
      "anType": "3GPP_ACCESS",
      "ngapMessage": "..." // This would contain the actual NGAP message as a binary payload
    }
    ```

-----

### 3\. Verify Compliance with Tracing and Logging

Your existing OpenTelemetry implementation is perfect for this. The goal is to make your traces and logs read like a 3GPP procedure log.

  * **Name Spans Correctly:** Your custom spans like `ngap_handover_request` and `ngap_resource_setup` are a great start. Ensure their names directly match the procedure names in the 3GPP diagrams.
  * **Log Payloads:** At the entry and exit of each API call, log the full JSON request and response. This allows you to manually check if the data structures and Information Elements align with the 3GPP specifications.

### A Practical Example: Making Your Handover More Compliant

Let's apply this to your `amf_handover` function in `amf.py`.

#### Step 1: Find the Specification

The procedure for an Xn-based handover (between two gNBs) is detailed in **TS 23.502, Section 4.9.1**. This diagram shows that the source gNB sends a "Handover Required" message to the AMF. The AMF then orchestrates the handover with the target gNB.

#### Step 2: Refactor Your Code

Instead of one large function, break it down to mirror the 3GPP steps.

**Before (Your `amf.py`):**

```python
@app.post("/amf/handover")
async def amf_handover(request_data: Dict):
    start_time = time.time()
    handover_request_counter.add(1)
    
    # Everything happens in one big function
    target_gnb_id = handle_ngap_handover_request(request_data)
    initiate_ngap_resource_setup(target_gnb_id)
    send_ngap_handover_command(request_data['source_gnb_id'], target_gnb_id)
    
    duration = time.time() - start_time
    handover_duration_histogram.record(duration)
    return {"message": "Handover process completed", "duration": duration}
```

**After (3GPP-Aligned Refactor):**

```python
# In this version, the function names directly map to 3GPP procedures.

def process_handover_required(ue_context, source_gnb_id, target_gnb_id):
    """Corresponds to the AMF receiving a Handover Required message."""
    logger.info(f"Processing Handover Required for SUPI {ue_context['supi']}")
    # Business logic to prepare for handover...
    return create_handover_request_to_target(target_gnb_id)

def create_handover_request_to_target(target_gnb_id):
    """Corresponds to the AMF sending a Handover Request to the target gNB."""
    logger.info(f"Sending Handover Request to target gNB {target_gnb_id}")
    # Business logic for resource setup...
    return send_handover_command_to_source("gnb001")

def send_handover_command_to_source(source_gnb_id):
    """Corresponds to the AMF sending a Handover Command back to the source."""
    logger.info(f"Sending Handover Command to source gNB {source_gnb_id}")
    # Finalize the procedure
    return {"status": "SUCCESS"}

# The API endpoint now just orchestrates the procedure
@app.post("/namf-comm/v1/ue-contexts/{supi}/handover")
async def amf_handover_procedure(supi: str, request_data: Dict):
    start_time = time.time()
    handover_request_counter.add(1)
    
    source_gnb = request_data.get("sourceGnbId")
    target_gnb = request_data.get("targetGnbId")
    ue_context = ue_contexts.get(supi)
    
    # Execute the procedural steps
    process_handover_required(ue_context, source_gnb, target_gnb)

    duration = time.time() - start_time
    handover_duration_histogram.record(duration)
    return {"message": "Handover procedure initiated"}
```

By refactoring this way, your code not only becomes more modular but also serves as self-documentation that aligns directly with the official standards.

Of course. A great UI for a 5G simulator using Shadcn/ui should feel like a modern developer tool‚Äîclean, informative, and highly interactive. The goal is to create a "mission control" dashboard that visualizes the network's state and allows you to trigger events.

I'd suggest a multi-pane, real-time dashboard focused on network topology, simulation control, and deep analytics.

---
## Overall Layout: The Mission Control Dashboard üöÄ
The foundation of the UI would be a **resizable multi-pane layout**, using the `Resizable` component from Shadcn/ui. This allows the user to focus on what's important to them at any given moment.

* **Main View (Center):** A dynamic network topology graph showing the NFs and their connections.
* **Control Panel (Left):** Buttons and forms to start/stop the simulation and trigger specific 5G procedures.
* **Analytics View (Bottom):** A tabbed section for viewing live metrics, logs, and traces.



---
## Panel 1: Network Topology & Status View
This is the main visual element, showing the health and activity of your entire 5G ecosystem.

* **Network Functions (NFs) as Cards:** Represent each component (AMF, SMF, UPF, gNB, etc.) using a Shadcn `Card`.
    * Inside each card, use an `Avatar` with the NF's initials (e.g., "AMF").
    * Include a `Badge` to show its status ("Online", "Degraded", "Offline") with corresponding colors (green, yellow, red).
    * Use `Progress` bars to visualize a key metric, like CPU load or the number of active sessions.
* **Live Traffic Flow:** Connect the cards with animated lines (using a library like React Flow or simple SVGs) to visualize API calls and data flow. For example, when a UE registers, you could show an animated pulse moving from the gNB to the AMF, then to the UDM, and back.
* **Interactivity:** Clicking on any NF `Card` would instantly filter the Metrics and Logs panels to show data only for that component.

---
## Panel 2: Simulation Control Panel
This is the interactive part of the dashboard, where you direct the simulation.

* **Global Controls:** Use `Button` components for primary actions like "Start Simulation," "Pause," and "Reset."
* **Scenarios with an Accordion:** Use the `Accordion` component to organize different actions.
    * **"Trigger Procedure":** A `Select` dropdown to choose a 5G procedure (e.g., "UE Initial Registration," "PDU Session Establishment," "Xn Handover"). An input field for the UE ID and a "Run" button would trigger the corresponding API call in your backend.
    * **"Inject Anomaly":** A section to test network resilience. Use a `Select` to choose an anomaly (e.g., "AMF Latency Spike," "UPF Packet Drop") and `Slider` components to control the intensity or duration. This would call your `amf-network_latency_simulator.py` script.
    * **"Manage UEs":** A `Table` showing all simulated UEs and their current status (`Registered`, `Idle`, `Connected`).

---
## Panel 3: Deep Dive - Metrics, Logs & Traces
This panel, using `Tabs`, provides the raw data for analysis.

* **Metrics Tab:** Display the live data from Prometheus.
    * Use a charting library that plays well with React/Tailwind (like Recharts or Chart.js).
    * Each chart would be housed in a `Card` with a title, such as "Handover Duration (p95)," "Active PDU Sessions," or "Registration Success Rate."
* **Logs Tab:** A live-scrolling feed of the logs generated by your Python services.
    * Use a `Table` with columns for `Timestamp`, `NF`, `Level`, and `Message`.
    * Use colored `Badge`s for the log level (`INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`) to make critical events stand out.
* **Traces Tab:** An advanced view for debugging specific procedures.
    * When you trigger a scenario like a handover, this tab could display the OpenTelemetry trace as a waterfall/Gantt chart, showing the duration and relationship of each span (`ngap_handover_request`, `ngap_resource_setup`, etc.).

## Key Shadcn/ui Components to Leverage

| UI Feature | Shadcn/ui Component(s) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Main Dashboard Layout** | `Resizable` |
| **NF Representation** | `Card`, `Avatar`, `Badge`, `Progress` |
| **Control Panel Organization** | `Accordion`, `Tabs` |
| **Scenario Triggers** | `Select`, `Button`, `Input`, `Slider` |
| **Live Data Display** | `Table` (for logs/UEs), `Card` (for charts) |
| **Notifications** | `Toast` (to show "Scenario Started" or "Anomaly Injected") |




























Visually showing 3GPP spec alignment means creating a UI that directly juxtaposes your simulator's live actions‚Äîlike API calls and data payloads‚Äîagainst the official 3GPP call flows and data models. It's about turning the dense specification documents into an interactive, visual checklist that validates your code in real time.

---
### The Core Idea: An Interactive "Specification Inspector" üïµÔ∏è
You would add a special "Compliance View" to your dashboard. When you run a procedure (like a UE registration or a handover), this view captures every event and presents it side-by-side with the 3GPP standard, providing immediate visual feedback on what your simulator did correctly and where it deviates.

Here‚Äôs how you could visualize the different aspects of compliance.

---
### 1. Visualizing Procedural Compliance (The Call Flow)
This view validates that your services are communicating in the correct sequence.

**Visual Implementation:**
You'd display a dynamic, two-sided sequence diagram.

* **Left Side (The "Spec"):** Render the canonical 3GPP call flow diagram for the selected procedure (e.g., from **TS 23.502**). All steps are initially grayed out.
* **Right Side (The "Simulator"):** As your simulator's services (AMF, SMF, etc.) make API calls to each other, their interactions are drawn in parallel on the right side.
* **The Validation "Magic":**
    * ‚úÖ When your simulator executes a step that correctly matches a step in the 3GPP flow, the corresponding step on the left **turns green** and gets a checkmark.
    * ‚ùå If your simulator misses a step, performs it out of order, or uses the wrong endpoint, the required step on the left **turns red**, instantly highlighting the non-compliance.



---
### 2. Visualizing Data Model Compliance (The Payload Inspector)
This view validates that the data being sent between your services matches the 3GPP-specified format.

**Visual Implementation:**
When a user clicks on any message (the arrow) in the sequence diagram, an inspector pane slides out using a Shadcn `Sheet` or `Dialog`. This pane is split into two columns.

* **Left Column ("3GPP Required IEs"):** A list of the mandatory and optional **Information Elements (IEs)**‚Äîthe data parameters‚Äîthat the spec says should be in that message. Each parameter can have a `Tooltip` with its official definition.
* **Right Column ("Simulator's Payload"):** The actual JSON payload that your simulator sent in that API call.
* **Live Validation:**
    * **Green:** Parameters in your payload that correctly match the spec.
    * **Red:** Mandatory parameters defined in the spec that are *missing* from your payload.
    * **Yellow:** Non-standard or custom parameters in your payload that aren't in the spec.

This provides an incredibly powerful way to debug your data structures and ensure they are compliant.

---
### 3. Visualizing N6 Interface & Service Chain Compliance
This view focuses specifically on the user plane path from the UPF to the Data Network.

**Visual Implementation:**
In your main topology view, you can make the N6 interface a special, interactive element.

* **Service Chain Visualization:** Show the UPF `Card` connected to a series of smaller, reorderable `Card`s representing your N6 service chain (e.g., "PAN NGFW," "NAT," "Traffic Shaper").
* **Policy Validation:** Clicking on the "PAN NGFW" card would open an inspector. This inspector could show the active firewall rules from your simulator (like the one in `simple_firewall.c`) on one side, and a checklist of required security policies on the other (e.g., "Block Port X," "Allow DNS Traffic"), with green checkmarks for policies that are correctly implemented.
* **Animated Data Flow:** When a PDU session is active, you can animate "packet" icons flowing from the UPF, through each element of the N6 service chain, and finally to the Data Network `Card`.

### Key Shadcn/ui Components to Build This

| Visual Feature | Shadcn/ui Component(s) | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Inspector Pane** | `Sheet` or `Dialog` | Slides in from the side to show detailed payload comparisons. |
| **Call Flow Steps** | Custom components styled like `Card`s | Used within a diagram library to represent each step. |
| **Validation Status** | `Badge` (with icons ‚úÖ/‚ùå) | Perfect for showing "Compliant" or "Non-Compliant" status. |
| **Payload Comparison** | `Table` | To structure the side-by-side view of required vs. actual data. |
| **IE Definitions** | `Tooltip` | Provides on-hover explanations for 3GPP parameters. |
| **Diagrams** | (External Library) | Use a library like **Mermaid** or **React Flow**, which can be styled with Tailwind CSS to perfectly match the Shadcn/ui aesthetic. |










The best way to see all your data is to use a combination of these components in a hierarchical system: a **top-level view switcher** for major modes, a **contextual sidebar** for navigating entities, and **granular filters** for refining the data within a view.

This layered approach prevents clutter and allows users to move from a high-level overview to specific data points intuitively.

---
### 1. Top-Level Navigation: A View Switcher
This component answers the question, "What task am I trying to accomplish?" It switches between the primary modes of your application. Instead of an "app switcher," think of it as a **view switcher**, implemented as a main navigation bar or a `Toggle Group` at the top of the UI.



**Key Views:**
* **Live Dashboard (Default):** The "mission control" view we've discussed, showing the real-time network topology, controls, and analytics.
* **Procedure Analysis:** A dedicated view for loading and replaying a saved trace from a specific 5G procedure (like a handover), showing the detailed compliance check and payload inspector.
* **Configuration:** A settings page to manage the simulator's parameters, network function endpoints, and UI preferences.

**Shadcn/ui Component:** `Toggle Group` or styled `Button`s in a main header.

---
### 2. Contextual Navigation: An Interactive Sidebar
This component answers the question, "Which part of the network am I looking at?" The sidebar is the best choice for this, as it provides a persistent, hierarchical list of all the major entities in your simulation.

**Key Features:**
* **Hierarchical List:** Use `Collapsible` components to group entities (e.g., Core NFs, RAN NFs, Active UEs).
* **Global Context Filter:** Clicking on an item in the sidebar (e.g., "SMF") acts as a powerful global filter. The entire dashboard‚Äîtopology, metrics, and logs‚Äîinstantly pivots to show only data relevant to the SMF.
* **Status Indicators:** Small colored dots or `Badge`s next to each item can show its real-time health status.

**Shadcn/ui Components:** `Resizable` (for the sidebar panel), `Collapsible` (for groups), and styled links.

---
### 3. Data Refinement: Granular Filtering & Searching Tools
These components answer the question, "What specific information do I need right now?" Once a user has selected a view (Dashboard) and a context (AMF), they use filters to drill down into the data presented in the main content area.

**Key Tools:**
* **Time Range Selector:** The most important filter for metrics. Use the `Date Range Picker` to allow users to view data from the last 15 minutes, 1 hour, 24 hours, or a custom range.
* **Search and Filter Bar (for Logs/Events):** Above the logs table, include:
    * An `Input` with a search icon for free-text searching.
    * A `Select` or `Dropdown Menu` to filter by log level (e.g., ERROR, WARN, INFO).
    * `Checkbox`es to toggle visibility of certain NFs if a global context isn't selected.
* **Topology View Options:** Use `Switch` components to toggle visual elements on the main graph, such as "Show Control Plane Links," "Show User Plane Links," or "Highlight Active Sessions."

**Shadcn/ui Components:** `Date Range Picker`, `Input`, `Select`, `Table` (with built-in column sorting), `Switch`.

### How It All Works Together: A User's Workflow

1.  **Start:** The user lands on the **Live Dashboard** view.
2.  **Navigate:** They see a high-level overview. To investigate a mobility issue, they click on the **"AMF"** item in the **sidebar**.
3.  **Contextualize:** The topology graph zooms to the AMF, and the metric and log panels now only show data from the `amf.py` service.
4.  **Refine:** In the "Logs" tab, they type `error` into the **search filter** to find specific issues related to the AMF, instantly isolating the problem.

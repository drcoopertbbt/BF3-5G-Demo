You cannot simulate an entire BlueField‑3 DPU environment through a full, official hardware emulation—but NVIDIA does provide two useful software-based alternatives for developers without access to physical hardware:

---

## 1. NVIDIA AIR (“Digital Twin”) Simulation of DPUs

According to the NVIDIA Developer Forum, NVIDIA AIR supports simulation of DPUs. As of March 1, 2025, NVIDIA’s Networking Technical Support confirmed:

> “Currently NVIDIA AIR has the ability to simulate DPUs. Please follow the guidance in the following link on how‑to create your Digital Twin → NVIDIA AIR.” ([forums.developer.nvidia.com][1])

This implies that AIR can create a digital twin of BlueField‑type DPUs—enabling developers to experiment with DOCA-based networking features, potentially including firewalls, RoCE, and other DPU accelerations. While official documentation may still be limited, the functionality appears actively supported.

## 2. DOCA Device Emulation Subsystem (DevEmu)

NVIDIA’s DOCA SDK provides a “Device Emulation” API that can emulate PCIe devices on a BlueField platform. This allows software to intercept I/O from the host and process it through software routines, acting as a stand-in for hardware device functions. Specifically:

* The subsystem permits emulation of PCIe devices such that the host is unaware of the substitution.
* It supports discovery, configuration, IO handling, and hot plugging.
* This is a low-level emulation approach, implemented through software running on BlueField. ([forums.developer.nvidia.com][1], [docs.nvidia.com][2])

**Important caveats**:

* It is currently supported at **alpha level**.
* Virtual Functions (VFs) are not supported.
* Behavior may not be fully compatible with actual hardware; consult with an NVIDIA representative for device-specific limitations. ([docs.nvidia.com][2], [docs.nvidia.com][3])

## Summary Comparison

| Simulation Option                  | Description & Use Case                                                                                          | Limitations                                                   |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **NVIDIA AIR Digital Twin**        | High-level simulation of DPU behavior for experimenting with DOCA networking features.                          | Documentation is sparse; support level unclear.               |
| **DOCA Device Emulation (DevEmu)** | Software-based emulation of PCIe devices on a running BlueField platform. Useful for low-level device modeling. | Alpha-level support; limited features; potential instability. |

## Suggested Next Steps

1. **Evaluate NVIDIA AIR as your first option** if your goal is to try out DOCA networking use cases, such as firewall rules or RoCE acceleration, without physical hardware. Check available NVIDIA resources or forums for guidance on setting up the DPU digital twin.

2. **Consider DOCA Device Emulation** if you need to emulate PCIe device behavior within a BlueField environment. Be prepared for limitations and integration challenges—they may require substantial low-level development and testing.

3. **Alternatively**, if your use case allows, you could deploy the **DOCA SDK on a host system or in a container**, then later test on actual hardware (via cross-compilation or development containers) when hardware becomes available. This path is well-supported in the DOCA developer ecosystem. ([forums.developer.nvidia.com][1], [developer.nvidia.com][4], [arxiv.org][5], [nvidia.com][6], [developer.nvidia.com][7])

**Conclusion**: NVIDIA does offer simulation alternatives—AIR for digital twins, and DOCA Device Emulation for modeling PCIe devices. While neither offers full hardware equivalence, they provide valuable development pathways when physical BlueField-3 units are not available. Let me know if you'd like help locating AIR setup guides or DOCA DevEmu API details.

No. The DOCA Device Emulation Subsystem is **not** distributed as a Python package and cannot be installed via `pip`.

It is delivered as part of NVIDIA’s **DOCA SDK**, which is installed on—or for cross-compilation against—a BlueField DPU development environment. The SDK contains:

* **C libraries** (`.so` shared objects) including `libdoca_devemu.so`
* **C header files** (e.g., `doca_devemu.h`)
* Build system integration files
* Example C applications

You use it by:

1. **Installing the DOCA SDK** on the BlueField platform or your host (for cross-compiling).
2. Including the header(s) in your C/C++ project.
3. Linking your application against the DOCA libraries.

If you want Python bindings, NVIDIA does not currently provide them for DevEmu. The official tooling is all in C/C++. Developers sometimes wrap DOCA APIs in Python using CFFI or SWIG, but that is custom work.

If you like, I can outline the **exact DOCA SDK installation steps** for getting DevEmu running on a BlueField-3 simulation or hardware. That way you’ll see where the library comes from and how to integrate it.
